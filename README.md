Lucas Reis
👨‍💻 Full Stack Developer | 💡 Technology Enthusiast

I carry with me the mission of reaching and helping as many people as possible, giving them a voice and a dignified life. I believe that technology can play a pivotal role in achieving this goal.

In February 2018, I started my journey in the IT field right after entering college. My first professional experience was with SQL Server at G7 Sistemas, a company that has been providing ERP solutions since 1998, focusing on information management for businesses of all sizes.

In May 2019, I had the opportunity to join TTI - Travel Technology Interactive ✈️, a prominent international company that has been offering IT solutions to the aviation industry for over 20 years. Over the course of 3.5 years as a full-stack developer (CLT), I worked on the development and implementation of CI/CD pipelines, version control, and the configuration/maintenance of various environments (development, testing, production). My work involved building and maintaining modules for airlines in areas such as sales, management, customer service, billing, and financial operations, as well as integrating different airlines via interline messaging and codeshare agreements.

In August 2022, I transitioned to a PJ role and continued providing services to TTI until April 2025.
